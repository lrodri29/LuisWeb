Throughout my college career I have had the opportunity to work as a Waility Assurance Specialist, a Research and Development intern and most recently, a Software Engineer at the Applied Physics Laboratory. I am a Big Data, deep learning, and machine learning enthusiast and most of my work revolves around the topic. In this website you can find some of the current project (both professional and recreational) that I am involved with.</p></div><div class="skill-lock"></div></section>
