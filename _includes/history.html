  package that parallelizes common data access workflows to allow for easy data transfer and analyses from different petascale databases through a single remote. I also developed a user web-based interface for a partner company using React-JS(front end) and FlaskApp (back end) to allow for easy big data access and data
  sharing between companies.</p><span class="cd-date">Summer 2017</span></div><!-- cd-timeline-content--><!-- cd-timeline-block--></div>
