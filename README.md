## **Overview of my Website**
I created this website to share a bit more about myself. In it you can find more about the projects I am currently involved in along with a bit about my history. The website was developed mostly using html and css as well as scss and is hosted on github pages.

Using Jeckyl I can easily update my information using markdown styled text. Writing in markdown facilitates my workflow.

You can find my website at [www.LuisRodriguezEng.com](http://luisrodriguezeng.com/).
