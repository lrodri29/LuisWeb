As president of the Chemical Engineered Car team at the Johns Hopkins University I have had the opportunity to lead a team of 20 engineers representing 5 different departments for 3 years. As the leader of the team I managed a budget of $10,000 dollars to be used to build a car which autonomously ran and stopped based on chemical reactions. The team then competed at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers Conference against other universities around the nation. The team's goal needed a dynamic team composed of chemical engineers, electrical engineers, computer scientists, and mechanical engineers all divided into three sub-teams: chassis, stopping and propulsion.

As the leader of the team I was involved mainly in management, budgeting and finding sponsors for our team, but since I really like getting more involved in specific tasks I lead the chassis subteam. As the leader of chassis, I was in charge of leading in the design and assembly of the car and considered both mechanical parts and electrical parts. Using SolidWorks and other CAD software my team designed the car and then soon after used laser-cutting techniques to build the parts we then assembled to make the car. The electrical circuitry of all cars, throughout my three years as leader have been executed by my team and I, and usually include the use of an Arduino UNO board as a controller for all the car's signaling and autonomy. 

Developed a website for members of the ChemE Car to have private access to announcement, scheduling and group reports. The website serves as a face for the ChemE Car Organization at Johns Hopkins University to inform visitors of the projects underwent by the team. The website also serves as a phone application which allows signed in members to have constant access to announcements, scheduling lab times and share reports.
