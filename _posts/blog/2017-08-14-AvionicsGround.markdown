In August of 2017 I joined the AstroJays. The AstroJays are a team of Johns Hopkins University undergraduates dedicated to learning how to design, assemble, and launch rockets. Each year, the team participates in the SpaceSport America Cup where over 1,100 students and faculty from more than 70 institutions, gather to collaborate and compete at a world class spacesport facility. The competition typically involves the designing building and flying of high powered rockets containing a significant payload in a professional setting.

I quickly became the team's payload leader by proposing the use of a current NASA project I had undergone at the university (You can check that project out here). Soon after I became the leader of the Avionics Ground Station team. The avionics sub-team is mostly involved with the electronics bay and telemetry readings the rocket needs to document and better predict future flights.......
